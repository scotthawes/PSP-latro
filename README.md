## <ins>Project Description:</ins> 
 
I did this for fun in whatever free time I managed to get.  
<ins>There is **no** roadmap and **no** plans for future updates, they may come or not, I will try to fix bugs whenever I can.</ins>
Not all implemented rules match the original game exactly, some of them I couldn't find information on (i.e. the probabilities of certain events).

### <ins>Features Implemented Now:</ins>
- Main in-game loop
- Shop (singles and boosters)
- Card enhancements
- Card editions
- 80+ Jokers
- Consumables **(except for spectral cards)**
- Full and remaining deck view
- Experimental background music implementation, works ok when overclock is enabled.
- Natural negative jokers

## **<ins>Build Instructions</ins>**

1.) Install the PSPSDK (link [here](https://pspdev.github.io/pspsdk/))
2.) Check if the following packages are installed for the PSPSDK (using for example psp-pacman):
    - `libzip`
    - `vorbis`
    - `liblzma`
    - `stb`
3.) run `make`

## **<ins>Run Instructions</ins>**

1.) Copy `EBOOT.PBP` and the files in the `assets` folder to a folder for the game in your PSP.
2.) Copy your official Balatro copy executable to that same folder.
3.) Modify the `settings.ini` file (see below for details). `(optional)`

## <ins>Configuration</ins> (`settings.ini` file)

The `settings.ini` file can have the following entries:
- archive_file_name (string) - the name of Balatro executable
- hand_size (number) - initial hand size
- hands (number) - initial hands
- discards (number) - initial discards
- wealth (number) - initial wealth ($)
- joker_slots (number) - initial joker slots
- consumable_slots (number) - initial consumable slots
- shop_item_slots (number) - initial shop single slots
- shop_booster_slots (number) - initial shop booster slots
- audio (boolean) - turn audio on or off (it is advisable to use with overclock)
- move_cards (boolean) - turn card oscillation on or off
- overclock (boolean) - set the CPU and BUS clocks to 333Mhz, which I believe it to be fine for the PSP, it may however drain the battery faster
- ante_score_scaling (int) - how the ante score scales (values from 1 to 3)
- speed (int) - how fast scoring is (values from 1 to 5)

## PSP Image Guidelines

When adding or replacing images (especially menu wallpapers), follow these PSP-focused rules:

1. Prefer 480x272 for full-screen menu backgrounds.
2. Keep source dimensions at or under 512 in each axis.
3. Use PNG assets with straightforward alpha (or opaque RGB if no transparency is needed).
4. Expect power-of-two texture buffers internally; non-power-of-two images are padded.
5. Very large images can be cropped to fit PSP texture budget.

### Wallpaper Files

Menu wallpapers are loaded from:

- `assets/wallpapers/title_wallpaper.png`
- `assets/wallpapers/title_wallpaper_b.png`
- `assets/wallpapers/main_menu_wallpaper.png`
- `assets/wallpapers/main_menu_wallpaper_b.png`

### Debugging Image Issues

In `DEBUG` builds, texture and wallpaper diagnostics are printed:

- `[WALLPAPER] trying|loaded|failed` for wallpaper candidate loading.
- `[TEX][WARN] Source image ... exceeds PSP texture budget...` when an image is too large and will be cropped.
- `[TEX] Loaded ...` and `[TEX] Loading from archive...` for source path visibility.

If an image does not appear:

1. Confirm dimensions are PSP-safe (ideally 480x272 for full-screen backgrounds).
2. Check logs for `[WALLPAPER] loaded` and `[TEX][WARN]`.
3. Ensure you are launching the latest `build/EBOOT.PBP` after rebuild.
